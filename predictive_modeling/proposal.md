# Proposal for Capstone 2

- Use clustering to find accident hotspots on the map of Seattle
- Visualize the hot spots on the map 
- find correlations between types of accidents and the types of spots they are happening in (and possibly other features like time of the day, day of the week)
- Predict accident frequency in a given week at a given spot
