- hot spots in different years (over time)
- predictions
-- try to predict just for the biggest hot spots
-- time patterns localized yo e.g. only downtown
- separate the city map into 10 categories of accident density
- heatmap / density
- find the nature of the hot spots (junction, street, what kind of junction)

- divide the city in collision frequency areas?
